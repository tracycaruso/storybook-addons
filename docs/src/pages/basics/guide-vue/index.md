You may have tried to use our quick start guide to setup your project for Storybook. If you want to set up Storybook manually, this is the guide for you.

> This will also help you understand how Storybook works.

## Starter Guide Vue

Storybook has its own Webpack setup and a dev server.  
The Webpack setup is very similar to [Vue CLI's](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), but allows you to [configure it however you want](/configurations/custom-webpack-config/).

In this guide, we are trying to set up Storybook for your Vue project.

-   [Create the NPM script](#create-the-npm-script)
-   [Create the config file](#create-the-config-file)
-   [Write your stories](#write-your-stories)
-   [Run your Storybook](#run-your-storybook)

## Add @storybook/vue

First of all, you need to add `@storybook/vue` to your project. To do that, simply run:

```sh
npm i --save-dev @storybook/vue
```

## Add vue, babel-core, and babel-loader

Make sure that you have `vue`, `babel-core`, `babel-loader` in your dependencies as well because we list it as a peerDependency:

```sh
npm i --save vue
npm i --save-dev babel-loader vue-loader vue-template-compiler
npm i --save-dev @babel/core babel-preset-vue
```

## Create the NPM script

Add the following NPM script to your `package.json` in order to start the storybook later in this guide:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "storybook": "start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook"
      }
    }

## Create the config file

Storybook can be configured in several different ways. 
Thatâ€™s why we need a config directory. We've added a `-c` option to the above NPM script mentioning `.storybook` as the config directory.

There are 3 things you need to tell Storybook to do:

1.  Import and globally register with [`Vue.component()`](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-component) any global custom components just like you did with your project. (Note: [components registered locally](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Local-Registration) will be brought in automatically).
2.  For any required Vue plugins (e.g. `vuex`), you'll also need to [install these with `Vue.use`](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-use).
3.  Require your stories.

Here's an example `.storybook/config.js` to get you started:

```js
import { configure } from '@storybook/vue';

import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex'; // Vue plugins

// Import your custom components.
import Mybutton from '../src/stories/Button.vue';

// Install Vue plugins.
Vue.use(Vuex);

// Register custom components.
Vue.component('my-button', Mybutton);

function loadStories() {
  // You can require as many stories as you need.
  require('../src/stories');
}

configure(loadStories, module);
```

This example registered your custom `Button.vue` component, installed the Vuex plugin, and loaded your Storybook stories defined in `../stories/index.js`.

All custom components and Vue plugins should be registered before calling `configure()`.

> This stories folder is just an example, you can load stories from wherever you want to.
> We think stories are best located close to the source files.

## Write your stories

Now you can write some stories inside the `../stories/index.js` file, like this:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';

import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/vue';

import MyButton from './Button.vue';

storiesOf('MyButton', module)
  .add('story as a template', () => '<my-button :rounded="true">story as a function template</my-button>')
  .add('story as a component', () => ({
    components: { MyButton },
    template: '<my-button :rounded="true">rounded</my-button>'
  }));
```

Each story is a single state of your component. In the above case, there are two stories for the MyButton component:

1.  story as a template
2.  story as a component

## Run your Storybook

Now everything is ready. Simply run your storybook with:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Now you can change components and write stories whenever you need to.
You'll get those changes into Storybook in a snap with the help of Webpack's HMR API.
