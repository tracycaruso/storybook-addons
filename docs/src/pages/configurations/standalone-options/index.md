There is also an API for running Storybook from the Node.

```js
const storybook = require('@storybook/{APP}/standalone');

storybook({
  // options
});
``` 

Where the APP is one fo the supported apps. For example:

```js
const storybook = require('@storybook/react/standalone');

storybook({
  // options
});
``` 

## Mode

Mode is defining what Storybook mode will be applied:

    dev - run Storybook in a dev mode - similar to "start-storybook" in CLI

```js
const storybook = require('@storybook/react/standalone');

storybook({
  mode: 'dev',
  // other options
});
```    

    prod - build static version of Storybook - similar to "build-storybook" in CLI

```js
const storybook = require('@storybook/react/standalone');

storybook({
  mode: 'prod',
  // other options
});
```    

Other options are similar to those in the CLI.

## For "dev" mode:

    Options:

      port [number]           Port to run Storybook
      host [string]           Host to run Storybook
      staticDir <dir-names>   Directory where to load static files from, array of strings
      configDir [dir-name]    Directory where to load Storybook configurations from
      https                   Serve Storybook over HTTPS. Note: You must provide your own certificate information.
      sslCa <ca>              Provide an SSL certificate authority. (Optional with "https", required if using a self-signed certificate)
      sslCert <cert>          Provide an SSL certificate. (Required with "https")
      sslKey <key>            Provide an SSL key. (Required with "https")
      smokeTest               Exit after successful start
      ci                      CI mode (skip interactive prompts, don't open browser)
      quiet                   Suppress verbose build output

## For "prod" mode:

    Options:

      staticDir <dir-names>   Directory where to load static files from, array of strings
      outputDir [dir-name]    Directory where to store built files
      configDir [dir-name]    Directory where to load Storybook configurations from
      watch                   Enable watch mode

  configDir: './.storybook',
});
```
